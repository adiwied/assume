    "## Introduction: Modeling Demand-Side Unit (DSU) Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the simulation of a **Steel Plant** using the ASSUME framework. The plant will be modeled as a **Demand-Side Unit (DSU) Agent**, which is designed to manage and optimise the operational regime/ energy consumption in industrial and optimising expenses for the residential agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept of DSU Agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Demand-Side Unit (DSU) Agents** are modeled to represent entities that consume energy and potentially participate in electricity markets. DSU Agents could be industrial units, like steel plants, or residential units, like buildings. These agents are equipped with various **technologies and components** that define their energy usage profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of DSU Agents:\n",
    "- **Components**: Each DSU is built from components that consume or generate energy. In this case, our **Steel Plant** is composed of:\n",
    "    1. **Electrolyser**: Produces hydrogen via electrolysis.\n",
    "    2. **DRI Plant**: Uses hydrogen to reduce iron ore, producing Direct Reduced Iron (DRI).\n",
    "    3. **Electric Arc Furnace (EAF)**: Uses electricity to convert DRI into steel.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Objective**: Each DSU Agent can have different operational goals, such as minimizing energy costs, optimizing load flexibility, or maximizing profit in electricity markets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Flexibility Measures**: DSU Agents are also designed to incorporate **Demand-Side Management (DSM)** strategies like **Load Shifting**. This allows the agent to respond to electricity prices or market conditions, making the operation more flexible by adjusting power consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective of This Tutorial:\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1. Set up a **Steel Plant** by defining its components and operational constraints.\n",
    "2. Connect the components to simulate the production process.\n",
    "3. Use **Demand-Side Management (DSM)** techniques like **Load Shifting** to optimize energy usage.\n",
    "4. Simulate and visualize the steel plant's energy consumption and flexibility.\n",

    "## Setting Up the Simulation Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through the process of setting up and simulating a **Steel Plant** using the ASSUME framework. This steel plant will connect components such as an **Electrolyser**, **DRI Plant**, and an **Electric Arc Furnace (EAF)** to optimize electricity usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Our goal is to create a steel plant model that minimizes the cost of electricity usage by simulating the demand and integrating flexibility using load-shifting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Cloning the ASSUME Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with the steel plant setup, we first need to **clone** and install the ASSUME framework, which contains the necessary modules for simulation. The installation guide can be found here: [ASSUME Documentation](https://assume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: If you already have the framework installed, you can skip this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you can proceed with setting up your **Steel Plant Simulation**.\n",
